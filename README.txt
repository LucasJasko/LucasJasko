Hi ! I'm Lucas,

I'm currently retraining to become a web developer at Metz Numeric School.
Eventually, I'd like to enter this field, which I'm becoming more and more passionate about every day. I've been studying the first programming languages for 2 year and have been able to carry out a few front-end projects along the way.

You can contact me via the linked-in link on this page.
